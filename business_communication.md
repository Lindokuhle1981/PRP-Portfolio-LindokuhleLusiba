## üí° STAR Reflection

**Situation:**  
During the work readiness training, I was required to prepare and deliver a short business presentation to demonstrate professional communication and clarity.  

**Task:**  
My task was to design slides and present information in a concise, professional, and audience-appropriate manner.  

**Action:**  
I structured the presentation with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. I practised speaking slowly and used professional language. I also reviewed email etiquette guidelines to improve my written tone.  

**Result:**  
I received positive feedback for confidence and clarity but was advised to add more visuals. I learned the importance of tailoring messages to different audiences, and I now apply this when writing formal emails and creating reports.

## üöÄ Next Steps
I will continue practising formal communication through simulated meetings and email writing, focusing on tone, brevity, and clarity.
