## üí° STAR Reflection ‚Äì Business Communication

**Situation:**  
As part of the Work Readiness module, I completed the Business Communication online assessment on 14 February 2025. The assessment tested my understanding of professional communication principles, including tone, non-verbal communication, and virtual meeting etiquette.

**Task:**  
My goal was to demonstrate knowledge of effective workplace communication and achieve a high score that reflects my ability to apply theory to real-world business interactions.

**Action:**  
I prepared by revising key topics such as the purpose of business communication, formal versus informal language use, and professional etiquette in digital communication. During the assessment, I carefully analyzed each scenario-based question and applied the principles I learned from the training.

**Result:**  
I completed the assessment in 26 minutes and achieved a final score of **80/100**. This result shows that I have a solid understanding of how to communicate effectively in professional environments. I particularly strengthened my awareness of tone and non-verbal cues in business contexts.

**Next Steps:**  
I plan to continue improving my business writing by practising professional emails and presentations. I also aim to refine my virtual communication skills by applying proper etiquette and body language during online meetings.
