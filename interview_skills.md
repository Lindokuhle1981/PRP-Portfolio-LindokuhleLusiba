## ðŸ’¡ STAR Reflection â€“ Interview Skills

**Situation:**
As part of the Project Presentation 3 module, I completed the **Interview Skills** assessment on 14 March 2025. This formative activity focused on essential interview techniques and best practices, including understanding interview purposes, applying the CAR/STAR method, researching companies, and structuring strong responses to common interview questions.

**Task:**
My goal was to demonstrate knowledge of how to prepare effectively for interviews and respond confidently and professionally to different types of questions. This included understanding how to present weaknesses constructively and how to communicate my value clearly to potential employers.

**Action:**
I studied key interview principles such as the CAR (Contextâ€“Actionâ€“Result) technique, reviewed sample interview questions, and practiced structuring responses using real examples from my academic and work experiences. I also explored how researching a company helps tailor answers and how to give an authentic response when asked about weaknesses.

**Result:**
I achieved a perfect score of **100/100**, completing the assessment successfully within ten minutes. This result demonstrates my strong understanding of professional interview techniques and my ability to apply them effectively in practical situations.

**Next Steps:**
I plan to apply these skills in upcoming internship and graduate interviews by:

* Using the STAR/CAR method to give structured and confident responses.
* Researching employers before interviews to show genuine interest and preparation.
* Continuously improving communication and self-presentation skills through mock interviews and feedback.

This evidence highlights my readiness to engage professionally and make a positive impression in real-world interview settings.
