As part of the Work Readiness module, I completed the Professional Networking online assessment on 22 March 2025. The assessment evaluated my understanding of building and maintaining professional relationships in workplace and career settings.

**Task:**  
My objective was to demonstrate strong knowledge of networking principles, such as the importance of professional connections, proper etiquette during networking events, and strategies to avoid common mistakes.

I prepared by reviewing notes from the networking training session and researching tips on how to build meaningful professional connections. I focused on understanding concepts like the "golden rule" of networking, introducing myself effectively, and following up with new contacts. During the quiz, I applied these principles to answer scenario-based questions quickly and accurately.

**Result:**  
I achieved a perfect score of **100/100**, completing the assessment in just over six minutes. This result reflects my clear grasp of effective networking strategies and the importance of professionalism when engaging with peers or industry professionals.

**Next Steps:**
