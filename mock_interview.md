## üé• STAR Reflection ‚Äì Mock Interview

**Situation:**
As part of the Interview Skills assessment, I completed a **Mock Interview** video where I demonstrated real-world interview techniques. This exercise aimed to simulate an authentic interview experience to help develop my communication, confidence, and professional presentation skills.

**Task:**
My objective was to apply all the theoretical concepts from the Interview Skills module ‚Äî including the STAR method, proper body language, active listening, and effective verbal responses ‚Äî to create a realistic interview scenario. I needed to present myself as if I were attending a real graduate or internship interview.

**Action:**
I prepared by researching common interview questions and planning concise STAR-based answers. I recorded myself responding to questions such as ‚ÄúTell me about yourself,‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat is your greatest weakness?‚Äù and ‚ÄúDescribe a time you solved a problem.‚Äù During the video, I maintained eye contact, used confident posture, and ensured my tone was professional. I practiced multiple takes to refine my delivery and clarity before submitting the final version.

**Result:**
The video demonstrated my ability to communicate clearly, structure answers using STAR, and display professionalism under simulated interview conditions. I successfully showcased self-awareness, technical knowledge, and interpersonal skills essential for future job interviews.

**Next Steps:**
To further improve, I plan to:

* Seek feedback from peers and lecturers to refine my interview delivery.
* Record additional mock interviews focusing on industry-specific roles.
* Continue practicing time management in responses to ensure concise and impactful communication.

This evidence highlights my readiness to engage effectively in professional interviews and apply learned techniques in real-world contexts.
