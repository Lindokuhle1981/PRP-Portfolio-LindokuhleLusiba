## ðŸ’¼ STAR Reflection â€“ Workplace Etiquette

**Situation:**
As part of the Work Readiness module, I completed the **Workplace Etiquette** online assessment on 27 March 2025. This assessment evaluated my understanding of professional behavior, communication, and conduct in a work environment.

**Task:**
My objective was to demonstrate knowledge of appropriate workplace behavior, such as how to handle difficult emails, maintain confidentiality, manage personal device usage, and show respect for professional boundaries and schedules.

**Action:**
To prepare, I reviewed materials on office professionalism, email communication etiquette, and company policies related to confidentiality and punctuality. During the assessment, I applied critical thinking to realistic workplace scenariosâ€”choosing the most ethical and professional responses, such as responding politely to a rude email, protecting confidential information, and arriving early for meetings.

**Result:**
I achieved a perfect score of **100/100**, completing the assessment in just over sixteen minutes. This result reflects my solid understanding of workplace expectations, professional communication, and ethical conduct within a team or organizational environment.

**Next Steps:**
I plan to further strengthen my workplace professionalism by:

* Practicing effective and polite written communication in all academic and professional emails.
* Continuously improving punctuality and time management habits.
* Applying confidentiality and ethical standards in all projects and collaborations.

This evidence demonstrates my readiness to adapt to professional environments and maintain proper conduct as I transition into the workforce.
